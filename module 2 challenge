This is my code for the vba script for the module 2 challenge. I was confused on how do a few things within the code so I provided 
links under a few parts of the code showcasing how I figured out how to do those parts. It took a lot of trial and error for the 
rest of the code. 

Sub Stocks()
    
    Dim TickerSymbol As String
    Dim OpenPrice As Double
    Dim ClosePrice As Double
    Dim YearlyChange As Double
    Dim PercentageChange As Double
    Dim TotalVolume As Double
    Dim GreatestIncrease As Double
    Dim GreatestDecrease As Double
    Dim GreatestVolume As Double
    Dim LastTickerRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim OutputRow As Long
    Dim FinalRow As Long
    Dim WorkSheet As WorkSheet
    
    For Each WorkSheet In Worksheets
        LastTickerRow = 2
        OutputRow = 2
        GreatestIncrease = 0
        GreatestDecrease = 0
        GreatestVolume = 0
        FinalRow = WorkSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
